# odin-recipes
My first Recipe website 
What i am doing right now is playing around with github to know that i can use it properly and understand it before i start my Project
My Project is going to be three recipes on a webpage with images of all the recipes and a step by step guide on how to cook all of them 
My first recipe will be BBQ mac and cheese pasta and is a personal favorite.
When my Project is finished it will show that I know the basics of HTML.
I will be able to make a webpage from scratch and add images with links and lists.
( come back and make this more professional and more easy to read with a spell check)
