My first Recipe website
This is my first Project with The Odin Project. I am building my first website and with this project It will show that I am able to build a website from scratch Using HTML and CSS.
I am able to make headings, paragraphs, add images and link websites together with html.
I am able to style the background color, font, headings and paragraphs and I have all the content centred.
In my index it is not pretty but it shows that I can change colors, spacing, size and create boxes for my content. I have shown the boxes very clearly with multiple colors and borders.
In my actual recipe pages I still have boxes but I have them blended in so you can not see them and I have changed the background color and font size/family to a color scheme I think is more nice to look at and works better.
Thank you for viewing my first project I hope you decide to make one of the recipes I have provided.
